# text-based-game

This project is a Text-based game, is a shcool project. 

This game has locations, which the game refers to as rooms. in some rooms there should be items, which can be look at, using the look function/command. if any items are in the current room, which the player is currently in. The take command which others may be more familiar with at the "pick up" command, should make the player able to take the items, in a given room, which contains items. 

This my first programming project, as such this, makes this a bg challenge for me.
